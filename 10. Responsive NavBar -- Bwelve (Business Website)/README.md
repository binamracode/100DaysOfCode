[![Responsive NavBar](https://i.postimg.cc/rmDY2Ssf/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/zb1knHnh)
This is simple and Responsive NavBar created using HTML, CSS and JS. It is not that much animated but I tried my best to design it as much as I can. Feel free to provide me suggestions if you want. You can see in codepen [here](https://codepen.io/binamra/full/xxRgaKR)

Thank You
