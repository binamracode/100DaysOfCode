[![Scroll To Top](https://i.postimg.cc/5tQZHh17/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/HJHSRPrX)
This is super simple and Responsive Scroll To Top created using HTML, CSS and JS. I used `scroll-behaviour: smooth` and added `#` in link of `<a>` tag to do this. Its super simple. I just used JS to hide scroll to top dynamically. You can see in codepen [here](https://codepen.io/binamra/full/yLVXoEW)

Thank You
