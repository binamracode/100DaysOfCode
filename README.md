Here, I took inspiration from [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/3913314-User-Profile/attachments/3913314-User-Profile?mode=media). This is simple User Card to show the info of user like his followers, social media infos, etc. in simple way. It is made in HTML and CSS.

## Day 2 - TODO App

Here, I created simple TODO App using React JS. You can see demo [here](https://xenodochial-babbage-44d5e8.netlify.app/). It is not responsive but works well one PC. It is made using Material UI. I know there are few mistakes as I am new to React JS.
