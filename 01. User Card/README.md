[![User Card](https://i.postimg.cc/8c7vgNs3/Web-capture-4-2-2021-212433.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/kRdGxrQF)
Here, I took inspiration from [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/3913314-User-Profile/attachments/3913314-User-Profilemode=media). This is simple User Card to show the info of user like his followers, social media infos, etc. in simple way. It is made in HTML and CSS. This may or may not be fully responsive but I tried my best to replicate as design of dribbble. Feel free to provide me best way if you think it can be imporved.

Thank You
